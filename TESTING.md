# Testing

Laptop is tested by using it to provision a fresh VM. The process is 
lengthy but scripted, and relies on Vagrant.

Currently, only the linux script is tested, and only on the precise 
distribution. See the dedicated section for information about OSX 
testing.

## Prerequisites

1. [VirtualBox][]
2. [Vagrant][]

[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/
[Vagrant]: http://www.vagrantup.com/

## Running the tests

1. From the repository root, execute `./test/runner.sh`

## Details

For each file found at `./test/Vagrantfile.*`:

1. Vagrant creates and starts a VM as described by the Vagrantfile
2. The appropriate laptop script is run inside the VM
3. Some assertions are made against the VMs state
4. Vagrant stops and destroys the VM

The following are the assertions:

1. The VM was brought up successfully
2. The laptop script(s) ran successfully
3. The VM reports the correct `$SHELL`
4. The VM reports the correct ruby

You can test idempotency (allowing you to run the script multiple times in the
same environment) by exporting `KEEP_VM` before running `./test/runner.sh` thusly:

  KEEP_VM=1 ./test/runner.sh

## OSX Testing

Adding additional linux tests via this framework should be easy: simply 
add a new Vagrantfile under the test directory which uses a base box 
with the desired distribution.

OSX will need to be handled specially:

1. The [VMware][] provider will have to be used
2. Building an OSX base box may or may not be easy
3. The resulting test can only be run on an OSX host

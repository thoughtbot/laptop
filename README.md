Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a macOS laptop for development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't  tested. Bug reports for older versions are welcome (but are probably better aimed at Thoughtbot/laptop upstream).

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeclan/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

macOS tools:

* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries.

[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/

Unix tools:

* [Git] for version control
* [Zsh] as your shell

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

Programming languages and configuration:

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Rbenv] for managing versions of Ruby
* [Ruby Build] for installing Rubies
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code

[Bundler]: http://bundler.io/
[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/
[NPM]: https://www.npmjs.org/
[Rbenv]: https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv
[Ruby Build]: https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build
[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

Databases:

* [Postgres] for storing relational data

[Postgres]: http://www.postgresql.org/

GUI Apps:

* Google Chrome for web browsing
* Atom and Sublime for text editing
* Slack for team chat
* Android Studio for mobile development

Fonts:
* Open Dyslexic for accessibility

We also install the Sublime Text package manager and a few default packages.

Finally, we remap the `§` key on your Mac's keyboard to the `#` symbol, which can make commenting Ruby marginally less painful...

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (though this depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Ideally you should write your customizations so that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`gem_install_or_update` and `create_folder_if_not_there`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

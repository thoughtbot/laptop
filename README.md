Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X or Linux laptop for Rails development.

Requirements
------------

### OS X

We support:

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

### Linux

We support:

* [14.04: Trusty Tahr](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes),
* [12.04 LTS: Precise Pangolin](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes),
* Debian stable (currently [wheezy](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/)).
* Debian testing (currently [jessie](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/)).

Install
-------

### OS X

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac) 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log

### Linux

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/linux) 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Laptop can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It will upgrade
already installed packages and install and activate a new version of ruby (if
one is available).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew install brew-cask

    brew cask install dropbox
    brew cask install google-chrome
    brew cask install rdio

You should write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than
once. See the `mac` and `linux` scripts for examples.

Laptop'ed Linux Vagrant boxes
-----------------------------

We now publish [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes with the Laptop script
applied for every supported Linux distro.

Create a Vagrantfile:

    vagrant init thoughtbot/ubuntu-14-04-server-with-laptop

In the same directory as your Vagrantfile:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

Laptop'ed vagrantcloud boxes currently available:

* `thoughtbot/debian-wheezy-64-with-laptop`
* `thoughtbot/debian-jessie-64-with-laptop`
* `thoughtbot/ubuntu-14-04-server-with-laptop`
* `thoughtbot/ubuntu-12-04-server-with-laptop`

See our [vagrantcloud profile](https://vagrantcloud.com/thoughtbot). You must
have Vagrant >= 1.5.0 to use vagrantcloud images directly.

Laptop
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SPBTV/laptop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SPBTV/laptop)

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)
* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SPBTV/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/SPBTV/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [ImageMagick] for cropping and resizing images
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Qt] for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* [Rbenv] for managing versions of Ruby
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code
* [Zsh] as your shell
* [XQuartz] for running headless browser

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew_tap 'caskroom/cask'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'brew-cask'

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

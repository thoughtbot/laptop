Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a Mac OS X laptop for development.

Requirements
------------

Install
-------

### Mac OS X

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomet/laptop/master/mac)

What it sets up
---------------

TODO: add list

It should take less than 1 hour to install (depends on your machine).

Laptop can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It will upgrade
already installed packages and install and activate a new version of ruby (if
one is available).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew install brew-cask

    brew cask install dropbox
    brew cask install google-chrome
    brew cask install rdio

You should write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than
once. See the `mac` and `linux` scripts for examples.

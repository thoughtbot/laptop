Laptop is a script to set up your Max OS X laptop as a Rails development machine.

Requirements
------------

[Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
if you're on Lion (OS X 10.7).

* zsh as your login shell.

To change your login shell run this from a Terminal:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

Install

Run the script:

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac)

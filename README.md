Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a Mac OS X or Linux laptop for Rails development.

Requirements
------------

### Mac OS X

1) Install XCode. This provides header files which are necessary for installing
certain Ruby gems. You can do this from the App Store. Make sure you open XCode
once to install any additional components.

2) Install a C compiler.

For Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8): Go to the [list of downloads listed on
Apple's developer site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) and
look for the latest version of "Command Line Tools (OS X Lion) for XCode" or
"Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for XCode". Download and run.

For Mavericks (10.9): run `sudo xcodebuild -license` and follow the instructions
to accept the XCode agreement.  Then run `xcode-select --install` in your
terminal and then click "Install". If this does not work, you can always
download the Command Line Tools manually as instructed above (just look for the
Mavericks version).

3) Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

Make sure to open a new tab in your terminal before proceeding or else the
laptop script will fail.

### Linux

We support:

* [13.10: Saucy Salamander](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/ReleaseNotes),

1) Install zsh and set it as your login shell:

    bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/linux-prerequisites)
